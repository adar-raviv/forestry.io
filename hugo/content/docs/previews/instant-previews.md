This feature is currently in beta.
{{% /warning %}}

With **instant previews**, you can take advantage of your static site generator's built-in "watch" or incrementally-updating mode to dramatically reduce the time it takes to refresh a Forestry preview, providing a shorter feedback cycle for editors working on your site.

## Adding an Instant Preview

Instant previews are configured just like other [build commands](/docs/settings/build-commands/). To use instant previews, navigate to **Settings** > **Previews**. Activate the **Instant Previews** toggle to enable this feature.

Once the **Instant Previews** toggle is activated, your dev server will start spinning up in our preview environment and you will be able to edit the **Instant Preview Command**.

You can edit the command used to run your dev server by editing the **Instant Preview Command** field.

### Preview Settings In _.forestry/settings.yml_

Alternatively, you can add your instant preview command directly to your configuration file in `.forestry/settings.yml` by adding a value named `instant_preview_command` under the `build` section. You can activate instant previews by adding `instant_preview: true` to the top-level configuration.

Here's an example of a live preview configuration in a `.forestry/settings.yml` file:

```yaml
instant_preview: true
build:
    instant_preview_command: hugo server -D --renderToDisk --port 8080 --bind 0.0.0.0
```

Your instant preview command will use the same **output directory** and **environment variables** as the standard preview command.

## Command Limitations

Your instant previewing command needs to be a "watch" style command that will start a process to watch for changes to your files, and rebuild your site automatically. This will most likely be the command that a developer would run in their local environment when working on the site, such as `hugo server` or `npm run develop`.

### Network Details

Your preview needs to run on **port 8080 and bind to all network interfaces on `0.0.0.0`**.

### Live Reloading

Forestry's live previewing relies on the built-in live browser reloading provided by your preview process. Instant previews have been tested and confirmed working with [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) and [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/).

## Default Instant Preview Commands

See [default build commands](/docs/previews/build-commands#default-commands) for the default instant preview commands for each supported SSG.

## Using The Preview

Note that your live preview will initially start on the homepage of your site, regardless of which content you initialize the preview from.
